# SPRING BOOT API

Basic API made to learn the basis from SRING BOOT and to be consumed in this frontend app [PersonsBillsApp](https://github.com/Lu1815/Person-Bill-ReactFrontend).

The endpoints are:

* /persona/
* /factura/

Persona has the whole CRUD methods and one especific more that finds a "persona" by "identificacion".

Factura only have three methods, findAll, store and findByPersona.

This API uses the H2 testing database.
